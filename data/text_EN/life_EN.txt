so i get a phone call from my mom, and she tells me that my father is about to get on an emergency life flight from our home in montana, to go to denver, to get an emergency liver transplant. my mom is kinda perennially optimistic, and she's telling me, don't worry, it's gonna be ok. we're gonna pull through this, it's gonna be alright. but i know something is is really wrong. so i get the next flight i can to go from where i'm living here in new york, hoping that i get there before my father dies. and i'm really glad i i got that flight as fast as i did, because i was able to spend a couple hours with my father, before he passed away. and before i know it, i'm at this side of his hospital bed with my mom, and we're sobbing because he's passed. um my dad was a he was a strong silent type, he was um he was a grew up on a farm, and he was the town one of one of two town eye doctors, so he could fix anything, you know, he could fix tractors or eyes, he could you know, no matter what. and he was always doing it, like behind the scenes, you know. he never wanted to take credit for it. um. it was apparent that my mom and i and um my two brothers were gonna have to be fixing things ourself, this time around. and the first thing my mom did was was to call my two brothers. one's a year older, one is a year younger. and it was gonna be really comforting to see my younger brother, we were really close, um, it was gonna, he was really gonna support me um. it was gonna be much more complicated seeing my older brother. um we'd always had a a really complicated relationship, and there was something really big about me that he did not know. and that's that the last time he saw me, um, years and years before, i was male. he was not aware that i had transitioned from being male to being female. and you know i always wanted to, to tell him. i was trying to find the right time, the right place, trying to you know, get up the nerve, um, i was worried about his reaction maybe that you know he was a bit conservative he had a temper, i didn't know how it's gonna happen, and i just kept s putting it off and, um, never found the right time. and here we are. at the time where i have to deal with all this stuff. uh marc wasn't the only one who didn't know my story, my whole hometown didn't know about me either. and you know i was trying to find a way to tell marc, i just kind of figured with my hometown, i just i just would never go back there again. so my mom uh calls my brother, and in one phone call tells him that he lost his father, and that he now has a sister. um. and i have to say i mean marc was he was really great. um. he he got off the plane, we met him at the airport, he gave me a hug, um but it was awkward as you can imagine. and you know i think we did what a lot of families do at times like that, you just kind of fall back on tradish tradition. and we um wanted to uh do something that my mom and dad had always done every year, um because you see it was my father's birthday. he had passed away twenty minutes before um before his his sixty fifth birthday. so we all went to applebee's, and we got a slice of sizzling apple pie, and put a candle in it, and my brother marc who really worshipped my father, got the honor of of blowing out the candle. and when he was blowing out the candle, i re i still remember the expression on his face. he was you know trying to process my father's passing, he was figuring out why it had been so long, that the two of us hadn't talked. something that really frustrated him. and um it was just all kind of coming together. i i took a business card out of my purse, uh it was for this job that marc didn't even know i had, it had my new name on it, and i wrote my cell phone number on it, and i gave it to marc, i said look, you know we haven't talked for so long, but here, any time, any place, no barriers, call me any t, we're, you know, we can talk anytime you want. and my mom started crying because her, you know her her children were reuniting, and also because sh you know for years she had been running interference between the two of us and using every excuse in the book to explain why i wasn't getting back to him or why you know packages to me were being returned because they had the wrong name on them and it, you know, her job running interference was over. so marc was in shock. um we were all in shock. i was i was in shock because i was thinking about the fact that, you know nobody in my hometown knew. and i'm wondering if i can go back for the for um the funeral. if i if i should go back. if my mom and and my brothers really want me to, really deep down. um and i'm thinking that, you know, i never even thought that i was gonna go back to my hometown, and now i'm being i'm being pulled back right into it. as contradictory as it may seem, as soon as there was a reason to go back, i had this really deep strong yearning to go back. i mean, i i had gone to school in new york and san francisco and travelled all over the world and this place that i thought of as home, uh that i think i really repressed, knowing that i couldn't go back there, right, i don't i don't need to go back there. but as soon as there was a reason, for me to go back there, very strong reason, i really really wanted to go. i wanted to see the house, the only house i had ever known growing up. i wanted to go back to my hometown and these people that, you know, comprise this community that i thought of as home, right. and my mom um reassured me that she she wanted me to be there, that she in fact needed me there for support. my brothers too. and my mom had a plan to get us there. you know, our our family had been separated for a long time, so she had the idea for all of us to rent a car, and drive the twenty hours from denver back to montana. so before you know it there we are in the car. you know, my has brother hasn't seen me for years, especially not as female, and here were are. and we we we had so much to do. we were plan, we were planning his servi my my father's funeral service. we were writing his obituary. my mom wanted to figure out and i did too wanted to figure out how we could introduce the information about me while still keeping the focus on my father. so she had me driving out in the you know, cross wyoming, seventy miles an hour, she had me take dictation of of her friends, and she wanted to invite them over for tea. so she had this really strategic list. it's like, you invite judy and she's gonna tell all the people in the arts community, that my mom was involved in. and you're gonna tell june and june is gonna tell all the people at dad's office, and we'll find somebody else in the she's gonna tell everybody uh at the church. and the next night, there they were, eighteen of my mom's best friends, uh and the minister from the church where the service was was gonna be performed. they're drinking tea,, my mom says you all know very well by now that i've lost my husband. and i know a lot of you have wondered what happened to my middle son, who seemed to disappear. and um, she said, i want you to know tonight that, i i have a daughter. and her name is kim. and this is my child. and i love my child. and i hope you do too. and we can focus on this tonight, we can talk about this tonight, um, you all are my ambassadors. if, someone has questions at the funeral and i'm caught up in things i want i'm going to point them to you and let you tell this story because you can talk about it in a sensitive way. and she um you know took a couple a couple questions from the people there. and the whole tea party,, ended slightly different than the tea party we hear about in the news, uh, the whole thing ended with everybody raising their teacups and saying, hip hip hurray for kim, hip hip hurray for kim. there were a couple amens and some applause and and then everybody went home and i swear there was a brownout from all the simultaneous phone calls that were being made dispensing the information, right? so then the next night there was a viewing f of of my father's body at the at the funeral home, and i had elected not to go because you know i didn't want the focus to be on me, i was gonna keep it on everybody, keep it on my father. um but my best friend tim from high school was at the viewing, and he calls me up, um he had only known the new me for a couple days, i hadn't even told him. uh but he knew me really well. and he knew i was chickening out. and he called me from the the the funeral parlor and he said, hey gotta lot of people here that really want to see you. um i should probably tell you that the people he's talking about are the football team. um cause i used to be on the football team. and so. applause for that eh? um and so tim says, where are you, i gotta lot of people who want to see you. i'm like, yeah i don't want to go, and you know i want to keep the focus on my dad, i don't want to be the. and he's like yeah, yeah, whatever. either you come down here, or we're gonna come up there, what's it gonna be? i said, i've i sh i come up here i guess. so before i know it the football team is at my front door. and couple of em have cases of beer under their arm. one case gets tossed in the snow bank to keep it cold, it's just like high school. and all of a sudden, they're in my living room. and it's this wake instantly. and a show of support for me and for the memory of my father. right. and they're in my living room, this living room i never even thought i would see again. and people were either laughing or crying, mostly laughing um and i remember looking around the room, and there there's there's kevin, he was one of the co- captains of the football team with me. and i look over there and there's my brothers marc and todd and they were you know we were all very close in age so we sh had friends in common and they're telling stories about my dad, and there's um i look ah um i look over on the couch, and there's frank, ah, sh probably should have ald you a also told you that, um, not only was i on the football team, but i was the quarterback um. and so i look over on the couch, and there's frank, he's an offensive lineman. it's the job of an offensive lineman to protect the quarterback. and frank is protecting me once again, twenty years later under very different circumstances. and he's got his arm around my girlfriend, they're laughing and knocking back cans of cheap beer, and that was the moment that i knew things were gonna be ok somehow. and there was one more person there that night, and that was my mom. and she told me something that we ended up repeating quite a bit that weekend, uh through the services. um she came up and she said, you know, dad was always fixing things and it looks like he fixed this too. she said, you know, even though your father has died, you've been reborn. thank you very much.
