under the influence is our topic tonight, and uh i i thought of a lot of different things. and and the one i kinda wanted to talk about was my secret influence. um there are people in our lives that are incredibly important to us and i would even m mention to say some of the most important people, everybody aside from my mother, in my life, doesn't know anything about this person, who i think about every day. and his name was michael marquis. so if this were a violin piece it would be called ode to michael marquis. um i met him when i was seven years old, and i was growing up uh my mother had left my father when i was about two or three and this was the first man that my mother had brought home, like, for me to meet. and uh he was a vietnam vet, he was a professional athlete, ah, he had played college football, college baseball, he was uh a ski instructor and a golf instructor uh he had like a big beard and he drank scotch and he had a german shepherd and he had a lab and he had this unbelievable m. g. and not like those little like wussy m. g. s that you see like it was like a nineteen thirty three m. g. it was like a motorcycle. i mean, this thing was so cool and the doors like went super low, you know i mean it was just so cool. and he was so cool. and he was the first person to really tap into um he may have tapped into it, he may have created it, i'm not sure but a momma's boy complex. um. which was that i had uh i hadn't been my my father lived in texas, and i hadn't been to texas since i was about three. but i was obsessed, i had a dallas cowboys belt buckle, i would wear, like you know um uh flower t shirts, you know, like grant parson's or something like that, i mean it's just about nineteen seventy seven i was very into that i only listened to willy nelson's the red headed stranger. um my room was covered with cowboys and broncos and indians and like anything texas was up my alley. and he met me and he's like, why what's all the texas stuff? you know? i was like, well, you know, my dad lives in texas.  well. he ain't here, is he? i'm like, n, nah. he's like, well i think i'd get over the texas thing if i were you. i'd be like, you know, that really hurt my feelings. and and he he proceeded to like latch into this thing, like, so what, you a momma's boy? cowboys lost today, did your dad call? no. right he's he's very tough guy. very tough guy. um and and through uh a little bit of, what what my mother felt was kind of abusive behavior, um uh uh i i grew to love him, right. i mean i hated him, but i loved him, i i i i thought about him all the time, and what he would think about something and and like uh for example, he decided that uh since i was so into football, uh but you don't know how to play football! you know? what name, know any, did your dad teach you to play football? no i don't think he did, did he? alright, come on, let's play football! no, it's, uh, i'm not looking for the pity thing. it's pretty funny. i mean he was a funny guy, he he was trying to help me, in his own weird way. so he takes me outside, he takes me outside, and he uh he says uh, alright, i'm gonna teach you how to play football. alright? but football is a man's game, it's not a momma's boy's game. alright? you put you you make a diamond, with your hands, your thumb to your forefingers, and if you can touch it, you can catch it. so i'm like, alright. bam! you know, and i'm he's like, you still with me, you still wanna play football? huh? i'm like, yeah, i wanna play football. he's like, alright! if you can touch it, you can catch it. bam! you know, and it this this went on, i mean and and too was freezing outside, and um and my nose is bleeding and um i'm crying and i want to go inside, and he's like, you know, you gotta catch this football. alright. and so finally i catch it like three times. he's like, alright! see, you're not such a little momma's boy after all and i feel kinda good about myself. i mean, you know, i mean, go figure, you know. so my mom really liked him, and um we moved to vermont, and he took us, and he moved us into this one bedroom one no it was just a one room cabin in vermont, where uh s he had this gig uh as a ski instructor. and um and it was really, picturesque, and he really had it in his heart like uh to teach me how to be a man. you know. and we would, he taught me how to chop wood, and he bought me um a jeans jacket and he would have my mom do like patches on the back. you know, and it was really very cool, and i started to feel very cool. he he took me to see um the man who would be king, um, and uh you know i cr i cried at the end, which is ah, this is a digression, i'm going to regret doing this, but but it's my favorite line and since i have an audience i have to tell you, it's it's like sean connery is standing on the burning bridge and and michael cain is shot, he's the bridge is burning, he's gonna die. and michael cain scrouts out, you know, peachy, will you ever forgive me for being so bleedin stupid and so bloody arrogant? and sean connery says you know that i can, and that i do. so like michael and i sat there and i just cried and he was just like pull yourself together, man! you know? we got in the car, he got his little m. g., and it's like freezing and i'm crying and he's like, come on! it was a good movie! it was sad, but it was, you know, you gotta you know, i loved it too! i loved it too. but like from then on in my mind, like michael and i were you know michael cain and sean connery and on adventures and things and we we had them. you know. i mean, i i had to walk i mean it's really kinda picturesque, i had to walk like two miles to school, and i was only in second grade, and it was very fun, he insisted that i do it you know by myself and my my mother had s a lotta problems with. like the the the you like my when my mother would go, she had to go outa town a couple times and he would take me on dates with other women and like, if you tell your mother, i'm gonna kick your ass. and uh but i thought it was great, i mean again, like you keep being judgmental, and i i was like i was like this guy is so cool. and um i remember i like rolled uh joints for him for this other girl. i don't know i i i have this vague memory of it but um uh, and finally like my most pivotal memory of him aside from the closing of my story, uh is uh is we had you know this little one room cabin. i mean it was really really uh idyllic. snow in vermont and all this other stuff, and and and michael, we're out on this little deck outside of it, and michael's like, see that, look at that buck! look at that buck! ok. get the shotgun. ethan.  get the shotgun. you know, and i'm i'm like i'm like  what for? he's like i'm gonna kill it! and i'm like i'm like i'm like, mom! michael's gonna kill a buck, michael's gonna kill a buck! michael goes hell i was gonna let you shoot it. you blew it. you know? and i didn't know how i felt, cause i didn't wanna shoot it, but now i felt like, i should have wanted to shoot it. and like, i don't know, i felt very strange. doesn't exactly make sense but you can understand the subconscious very influenced. um and so finally one day i come walking home from school, this little cabin, and all my mother's underwear and lingerie kinda like things are nailed to the outside of the house. right. this is a true story, alright. and i'm like wow, that's weird. you know.  and  and and uh and inside there's like ra ra ra ra ra ra ra you know, ba ba and um uh you know, we basically get in the car and we're gone. and uh we move to atlanta, georgia. and um you know i don't know any more about what happened there than you do. i mean lingerie, fighting, i don't i can guess, you know, but i've never asked my mom, my mom has a lot of issues. but that's not, this is michael's ode. um and so anyway, we move to atlanta, georgia, and what happens is my father uh gets remarried and for some reason to my now eight year old mind this is very disturbing. um i'm not invited to the wedding and i'm very upset about this and and it it it's kind of throwing my whole texas fantasy scheme a a a apart and i get uh but i'm ih i'm in this like weird school in atlanta georgia and i actually get accepted to this a this um little gifted and talented program. like for an eight year old, right. and i i go to. and i get kicked out on the second day, cause i telled some told some kid that his painting sucked. right? or the teacher uh uh i didn't get kicked out right away uh uh i had to write a one page essay about why um i would you know about w i was supposed to write about why saying somebody's painting sucked was a bad thing. and i wrote in my essay that i didn't know that it was something bad, because my mother goes out with lots of guys, and the last one that she dated, told me i sucked all the time, and i didn't think it was that big a deal. now that that that sounds like, the truth is i knew exactly what i was doing. like and it wasn't like it i was trying to make my mom look bad in front of the teachers, to like deflect um y you know me being in trouble. i my mom was so angry at me. she hon like like she got this call, from the teacher and she hangs up, yeah yeah yeah you little shit. you, you know? uh i don't date lots of guys. and michael didn't say you sucked. yes he did. alright he did. but you know like, bla bla and um anyway the point is, and then i got in a fight, and i got kicked out of this gifted and talented thing, and it was like a big deal, and my father's getting remarried and they sent me to a child psychologist and and my mom comes up with this idea that she's gonna invite michael to come to my birthday. like that i i could really use this, right. but i i don't know about this. but so my birthday arrives. and we're living in atlanta, georgia now and who comes down the street in a little m. g. with the golden retriever right on the side thing and his hair and his beard and he's got the, th, you know thing, and a bunch of presents in the back comes pulling up. and it it was really one of the greatest moments of my li, i mean i was so happy to see him. and i had all these boys come over um for my birthday party, and michael took turns taking us around the block and he would like peel out, fishtail around the thing and and my mother would be screaming michael and all the boys would be like, your dad is so cool. and i'd be like, i know. i know he's so cool. and i i was just it was really one of those glorious days. michael took us all to chuck e cheese's, and we went to see george burns in oh god, and like and everybody was just so into michael. and i by you know association was a very studly guy. and um and so then it's, the night's over, and uh michael's gonna leave. you know, michael says, goodbye! and i say, alright, see you later. and he starts to go. and i go to my room, and i start sobbing. right. and um and and so my mother comes in, and is like, what are, what are you, what are you crying about?
